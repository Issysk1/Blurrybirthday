  <h2>A short story</h2>

  <p class="storyText">One day, a girl was born.</p>
  <img src="Child.png" class="storyImg hidden">

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    She learned the world slowly.<br>
    She noticed the little things others missed.<br>
    Even when she was quiet, she understood more than she let on.
  </p>

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    As she grew, she tested people without meaning to.<br>
    Some gave up. Some tried too hard.<br>
    She remained calm, even when she wondered why the world rushed.
  </p>

  <img src="hot1.png" class="storyImg hidden">

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    Time shaped her in small ways.<br>
    Patience became second nature.<br>
    Depth became visible in subtle gestures.
  </p>

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    She learned to laugh quietly, sometimes at herself.<br>
    She learned to watch carefully, choosing when to speak.<br>
    And she grew into someone who isn’t easily guessed.
  </p>

  <img src="hot2.png" class="storyImg hidden">

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    People often misread her, but she didn’t mind.<br>
    Her instincts were sharper than they appeared.<br>
    The world expected one thing; she gave another.
  </p>

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    Not everyone notices. Some never do.
  </p>

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    And now, on this day, she exists as she always has:<br>
    quietly precise, slightly unpredictable, entirely herself.
  </p>

  <p class="storyText hidden">
    Happy Birthday.
